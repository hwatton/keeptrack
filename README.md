# Typescript/react/router tutorial

A handsonreact tutorial covering the basic use of Typescript in react. 
(https://handsonreact.com/docs/labs/react-tutorial-typescript)

A bit of Router, (with unexpected v6 workarounds/extra learning) and some local REST api stuff.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
